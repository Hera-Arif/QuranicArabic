This lesson is about the Arabic Alphabet (حروف الہجاء)
1. With a minor disagreement on the number of alphabet following table shows
the Arabic alphabet in the order as they would appear in dictionary.
2. Some count the alphabet Alif (ا) and Hamza (ء) as separate and their count of
the alphabet is 29, others consider them to be the same and count the number of alphabet as 28.
